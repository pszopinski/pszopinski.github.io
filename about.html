  Hello and welcome to my personal website! I'm Paweł Szopiński, a Software
  Engineer venturing into the world of web development. Let me share a bit about
  my journey with you.

  My journey in software engineering began with a fascination for the web. At
  the age of 12, I delved into creating simple websites using (X)HTML, CSS and
  JavaScript. During the summer break, I expanded my skills by learning PHP and
  SQL. Throughout my school years, I continued honing my skills and expanding
  the scope of my projects.

<p>
  However, as university life unfolded, the demands of my studies left me with
  little time for web development. In my 3rd year, my focus shifted to C++ and I
  stayed in that niche, working in telecommunications and then the music
  industry.

  In late 2023, I hit a pause button in my life due to depression. During this
  challenging time, I took a step back and looked at the bigger picture, which
  included assessing my career. In therapy, it became clear that I needed to
  take control of my professional path and pursue something I'm genuinely
  passionate about&mdash;web development. With incredible support from my
  therapist and my now husband, I'm on a journey to turn this dream into
  reality.
